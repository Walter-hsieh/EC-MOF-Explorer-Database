🧪 EC-MOF Explorer & DatabaseAn interactive, searchable, and filterable web application designed to help researchers and students explore a comprehensive database of Electrically-Conductive Metal-Organic Frameworks (EC-MOFs). This tool provides a modern, intuitive interface to discover and compare MOFs based on their constituent metals, ligands, and conductivity.(Action Required: Replace this link with a screenshot of your live application!)✨ FeaturesThe EC-MOF Explorer goes beyond a simple list, offering a powerful set of tools to navigate the data:⚡ Interactive Live Search: Instantly filter the entire database by typing in the search bar. The search scans MOF names, ligands, and application descriptions in real-time.🔬 Multi-Select Metal Filtering: Compare materials by selecting multiple metals at once using a clean checkbox interface.🎚️ Dynamic Conductivity Slider: Use the logarithmic slider to intuitively narrow down your search to a specific range of electrical conductivity, from highly insulating to highly conductive materials.📊 Smart Sorting: Effortlessly sort the results by MOF Name (A-Z), Conductivity (High to Low), or Conductivity (Low to High).🖼️ Rich Information Cards: Each MOF is presented on a clean, modern "card" that displays all key information at a glance, including the ligand's molecular structure.🌐 Direct Google Search: Instantly perform a Google search for any research title with a single click to find the original publication and related works.📱 Fully Responsive Design: The interface is designed to work beautifully on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.🛠️ Tech StackThis project was built using a lightweight and efficient stack, focusing on a fast user experience without the overhead of a large framework.Frontend:HTML5: For the core structure.Tailwind CSS: For all styling and the responsive layout.Isotope.js: For the magical filtering, sorting, and grid layout.JavaScript (ES6): For all client-side logic and interactivity.Backend & Deployment:Node.js: To run the web server.Express.js: A minimal server to serve the static files.Heroku: For hosting and deployment.🚀 How to Run LocallyTo run this project on your own machine, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
